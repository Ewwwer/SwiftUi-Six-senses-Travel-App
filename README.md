A travel app write in SwiftUI for personal proposals, it's for learn

I've made only the first page of login

1 need to -> funcional login
2 navigationbars and navigation funcions
3 scrape with Python (maybe?) some travel pages for take informations and prices
4 use some Json info for login & world travel places
